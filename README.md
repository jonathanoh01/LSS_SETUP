# LSS_SETUP


The purpose of this GitHub repository is to showcase scripts that have been created by Jonathan Oh.


All the following code has been written and developed by Jonathan Oh during his duration at School of International Letters and Culture's Learning Support Services.


Please note, all sensitive information/data has been omitted from these scripts. If it seems as if there are some inconsistencies in the code, such as indexes not matching up, it is likely that a chunk of code has been omitted for obvious reasons.
